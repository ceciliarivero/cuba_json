1.0.0

- Malone.configure has been replaced with Malone.connect
  Use Malone.current to retrieve the last configured Malone
  instance (using Malone.connect)

- Malone.deliver has been replaced with an instance method.
  Call deliver (with the same arguments as before) on the
  return value of Malone.connect or Malone.current.

- Malone#deliver now receives :text and :html instead of :body.

- No need to pass in TLS. it's tries to do TLS automatically.

- Errors during SMTP authentication (and any other error) aren't
  trapped silently now. (via @tizoc, @elpollila)

- Configuration parameters are more strict (i.e. passing :password
  would throw a NoMethodError via @tizoc, @elpollila)

- malone/sandbox has been renamed to malone/test.
